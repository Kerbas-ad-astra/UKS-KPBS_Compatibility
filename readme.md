===

This is a set of configuration files to allow use of the Kerbal Planetary Base System parts with the USI Kolonization System gameplay mechanics.

### Dependencies

- [Kerbal Planetary Base System] (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/127413-WIP-1-0-4-Kerbal-Planetary-Base-Systems-v0-2-4-Update-13-9-2015) by Nils277

### Installation

Drop the UKS-KPBS_Compatibility folder into your GameData folder wherever KSP is installed.

### Features

- The large KPBS Greenhouse functions as a UKS Aeroponics Module
- The KPBS Algae Farm functions like a UKS Inflatable Agriculture Module
- The KPBS Habitat Mk2 functions as a UKS Kerbitat Module
- The KPBS Habitat Mk1 functions like a double-capacity UKS Inflatable Habitat Module
- The KPBS Command Module has the power distribution capability of the UKS PDU
- The KPBS Science Laboratory has the nuclear enrichment capability of the UKS PDU
- The KPBS Cupola works as an Survey Station for Extraplanetary Launchpads
- Switchable storage for UKS resources in two sizes for the KPBS modular storage system
- The small KPBS greenhouse functions like the USI-LS Nom-O-Matic 5000

Note: due to the mass and volume of the deployable KPBS Greenhouse and Habitat, their capacities are double that of the UKS Aeroponics and Kerbitat Modules. To balance this, they receive only half the normal bonus from nearby efficiency parts.
