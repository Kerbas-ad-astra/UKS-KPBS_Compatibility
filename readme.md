This is a set of configuration files to allow use of the Kerbal Planetary Base System parts with the USI Life Support & Kolonization System gameplay mechanics.

### Installation

Delete any existing installed version of this mod, then drop the UKS-KPBS_Compatibility folder into your GameData folder wherever KSP is installed.

### Features

USI Life Support functions are added to KPBS modules:

- The Habitat Mk1 works as a mid-grade life support recycler (34%); the Science Lab has a 71% recycler; and the Habitat Mk2 has the highest-efficiency recycler (90%), but requires Water as input.
- The Habitat modules have habitation space.
- The Cupola works as a habitation multiplier.
- The small (wedge-shaped) and large (deployable) Greenhouse use Agroponics to convert Mulch and Fertilizer into Supplies.

UKS features are also incorporated:

- The large Greenhouse has a Cultivator to turn Substrate, Water, and Fertilizer into Supplies.
- The Command Module works as a power & resource distributor.
- All modules incorporate a power coupler to tap into the power distribution network.
- Switchable storage wedges in two sizes are added for UKS resources; these function as distribution warehouses like Kontainers.

Finally, the small Algae Farm is hidden as its functionality is incorporated into other parts.

### Known Issues

The switchable storage wedges use the NOMS texture for every configuration. If you can create custom textures, feel free to submit a pull request!
